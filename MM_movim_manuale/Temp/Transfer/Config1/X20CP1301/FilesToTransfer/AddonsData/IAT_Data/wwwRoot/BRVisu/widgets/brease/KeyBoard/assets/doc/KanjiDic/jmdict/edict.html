    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER> The EDICT Dictionary File</H1>
    <P>
        Welcome to the Home Page of the EDICT file within the JMdict/EDICT Project.
        This page has been written by Jim Breen
        (hereafter "I" or "me") and is intended as
        an overview of the file, with links to more detail elsewhere.
    </P>

        <B>Background</B>
    </P>
    <P>
        Way back in 1991 I began to experiment with handling Japanese
        text in computer files, and decided to try writing a dictionary
        search program in Turbo C under DOS, which used a simple dictionary file
        contained in the
        MOKE (Mark's Own Kanji Editor) package. To make this program more
        useful, I began to expand the file itself. One thing led to another,
        until I ended up running a fairly major project which has taken over a
        large portion of my life.
        I must acknowledge that the EDICT project has depended on many people who
        have provided material and editorial assistance. A significant
        proportion of the
        compilation process has been carried out using electronic mail and
        file transfers, and indeed the project would never have occurred
        without the services provided by the Internet.
    </P>
    <P>
        <B>What is EDICT?</B>
    </P>
    <P>
        EDICT is a Japanese-English Dictionary file. For the full details, see
        the
        <a HREF="edict_doc.html">full documentation, </a>
        or the
        <a HREF="edict_doc_old.html">old documentation. </a>
    </P>
    <P>
        It is a plain text document in EUC-JP coding, with its own format (which
        has become known as "EDICT-format").
        Originally it was compiled and
        edited in this format, but from 1999 it has been generated as a legacy
        file from an expanded  database, along with the related
        <a HREF="j_jmdict.html">JMdict </a>
        (Japanese-Multilingual Dictionary) project. JMdict is an expanded file,
        containing French, German, Russian, etc. translation, and is in XML format
        and UTF-8 coding. In 2010 the maintenance was moved to an online database
        system.
    </P>
    <P>
        There are now two EDICT versions:
    </P>
    <OL type="A">
        <LI>
            the plain EDICT file. This is the original format, where there is
            only one kanji form and one reading per entry. I regard this as a legacy
            format, and only provide it for older applications. PLEASE do not use
            this format for new applications, as I would like to withdraw it one
            day.
        </LI>
        <LI>
            the enhanced "EDICT2" format. This can have multiple kanji forms and
            readings in an entry, and also has other information such as
            cross-references, restrictions, etc.  and also uses kanji from the
            extensions in the JIS X 0212 standard. It has almost all the information
            in the full JMdict format. This form should be used for all new
            applications.
        </LI>
    </OL>
    <P>
        The EDICT2 file currently has about 175,000 entries, and the legacy
        EDICT format has nearly 200,000 entries (many of which are duplicates
        as all the permutations of
        kanji and readings generate distinct entries.)

                    This uses the WWWJDIC server via its API, and needs network access. It
                    has the advantage of always being up-to-date as the dictionary is
                    expanded and corrected.

                    which is very highly regarded. It is similar to AEdict, but uses the
                    JMdict data and hence provides all the information from the dictionary.

    <B>Romaji?</B>
    <P>
        None of the files in the EDICT project use romanized Japanese.
        I get many requests for a romaji version of EDICT, however as I do not like
        romaji and do not want to encourage its use, I will not be producing
        romaji versions. There <b>is</b>
        a romaji version dating from 1997 on the Monash ftp site. This was
        prepared for a blind person who was using a non-Japanese Braille
        interface. I (foolishly) placed it on my ftp site, and I have had a lot
        of problems since it was not in step with the main file. That file is
        now withdrawn, and I am asking all sites carrying copies to withdraw it.
